Certainly! Here are the two paragraphs condensed further:

In my professional journey, I have developed mobile applications using Flutter and React Native, focusing on state management and user interface design. I have managed backend services with Node.js, Express.js, and Spring Boot, and worked with databases like MySQL, Firebase, and MongoDB. 
I effectively used Git and GitHub for version control and collaborated on group projects, contributing to both front-end and back-end development within agile processes.

            I successfully built three mobile apps: a Personal Expense Tracker App, a To-Do List App, and a Recipe App, and contributed to the Smart Governing Portal. Additionally, I developed the RecyclingApp and a MoviesTicketBooking website using Flutter and Firebase,
            and an e-commerce app, BuyShoes, with React Native, MySQL, and Spring Boot. I consistently met project deadlines and received positive feedback for my problem-solving skills, thriving in dynamic environments and continuously embracing new challenges in software development.
